# Module 10 Assignment: Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker

## Getting Started

This project involved creating a .svg file logo; starting with picking from shapes (circle, triangle, square), a hex color, and up to 3 character text for the center of the logo.

There was no starter code this week, so I relied heavily on re-watching previous lessons, tutoring, chatgpt, google, and the BCS Xpert. The file structure was provided, so it was very

helpful to start from there! After installing inquirer and jest, it was recommended I start with my shapes.js and shapes.test.js to be able to npm test the functionality of my method setup 

for the logo basic setup (color/shape). I was able to move to index.js after to initiate the inquirer prompts for the user to be able to select their logo needs.

I started the whole process, with a very basic outline of what I wanted each file to store, making comments through out the page of how I wanted something to function or look.

**User Story**

- AS a freelance web developer
- I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
- SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

**Acceptance Criteria**

- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted for text
- THEN I can enter up to three characters
- WHEN I am prompted for the text color
- THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- WHEN I am prompted for a shape
- THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
- WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
- THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
- THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
- AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
- WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
- THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
